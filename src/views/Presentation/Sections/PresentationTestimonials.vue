              Unlike traditional formal logic systems, Cultural Reasoning Model (CRM) is designed to handle
              <strong>complex, multi‑step reasoning tasks</strong> 
              embedded in socio‑cultural contexts—such as those found in legal interpretation and
              linguistic pattern discovery (e.g., International Linguistics
              Olympiad problems). It captures the non‑monotonic, defeasible and
              interpretive nature of human reasoning by aligning semantic
              inference with normative structures and cultural knowledge. CRM
              emphasizes not only logical validity but also interpretive
              plausibility, coherence, and cross‑cultural appropriateness. This
              makes it particularly suitable for applications where reasoning
              must reflect both internal structural rules (e.g., grammatical or
              legal systems) and external contextual norms (e.g., social
              conventions, legal precedent, pragmatic intent). As such, CRM
              provides a unified foundation for modeling reasoning tasks that
              require both symbolic abstraction and cultural
              alignment—bridging the gap between language, law, and human
              cognition.
